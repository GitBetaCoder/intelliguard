IntelliGuard
============

Obfuscation made easy.

IntelliGuard integrates yGuard - a free Java bytecode obfuscator - with IntelliJ IDEA. Key features are:

* No more hazzles with configuration files. Just hit ALT+ENTER on any symbol in the editor for keep options.
* Refactor support. Kept symbols remain unobfuscated after rename or move.
* Inspections for common obfuscation mistakes.
* Optional (toggleable) gutter icons for obfuscated symbols.
* Export configuration for yGuard and ProGuard format.
